### 2\. `StackProps.builder()`

-   **What it is**: This is the entry point for the builder pattern. The builder pattern is a design pattern used in object-oriented programming to construct a complex object step-by-step.

-   **Purpose**: Instead of using a constructor with a long list of parameters, the builder pattern provides a more readable and flexible way to set properties. You call a series of methods (like `.synthesizer(...)`) to set the desired values, and then you call `.build()` to create the final `StackProps` object.

### 3\. `.synthesizer(new BootstraplessSynthesizer())`

-   **What it is**: This is the core part of the line. It's a method call on the `StackProps.builder()` that sets the `synthesizer` property.

-   **`synthesizer`**: This property defines the *synthesizer* that the CDK will use. A synthesizer is the component responsible for translating your CDK code (e.g., `new s3.Bucket(...)`) into a CloudFormation template.

-   **`new BootstraplessSynthesizer()`**: This is the specific synthesizer being used. To understand its significance, you need to know about the standard CDK deployment process.

#### The Standard CDK Process (Default Synthesizer)

Normally, when you use the CDK to deploy to an AWS account for the first time, you run `cdk bootstrap`. This command deploys a small CloudFormation stack that creates a few essential resources, including:

-   An S3 bucket to store assets (like Lambda code, Docker images, etc.).

-   IAM roles and policies that the CDK uses to deploy your resources.

This bootstrapping process sets up the necessary prerequisites for the CDK to work. The default synthesizer assumes these resources exist and uses them during the deployment.
